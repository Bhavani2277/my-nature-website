	<h1><u>Don't Cut Trees!</u></h1>
	<p>
	<font size="5" face="arial" color="black">
		Save trees is a slogan used to motivate people to save trees and plant more trees in the surrounding areas by spreading the importance of trees among people as well as reduce deforestation and cut down of trees. Trees are as much important to our life as food and water. Life becomes very difficult without trees or we can say that life would be finished because trees are most important aspect of giving us healthy and wealthy life. Save trees is the important social awareness now-a-days and have been included in the student’s life through the study.<br>

	Trees gives us life and really very important for the survival on the earth. Many people are dependent on the tree for their survival economically for example paper industries, rubber industries, match industries, etc are totally dependent on trees. The main role of trees is giving fresh and oxygenated air to us and consumption of CO2 however they also give protection, shadow, food, source of money, home, medicines, etc to the people.<br>

	Trees are the source of rain on the earth as they attract clouds which ultimately bring rain. They also help in checking soil erosion and keep environment fresh by preventing from pollution. They are the home of wild animals and source of wild life in forests. Trees are very helpful and useful friends of humanity. They clean soil by filtering sewage and chemicals, control noise pollution, air pollution, reduce flash flooding, etc. By seeing the importance and value of trees in our life, we should honour and save trees in order to save life and environment.<br>

    <h1><u>Don't Waste Water!</u></h1>
    <p>
    	<font size="5" face="arial" color="black">
    	<u><i>Save Water in the Kitchen and Laundry:</i></u><br>
Use your automatic dishwasher only for full loads.<br>
Use your automatic washing machine only for full loads.<br>
If you wash dishes by hand, don't leave the water running for rinsing.<br>
Don't let the faucet run while you clean vegetables.<br>
Keep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator - running tap water to cool it off for drinking is wasteful
Check faucets and pipes for leaks.<br>
<u>Save Water in the Bathroom:</u><br>
Check your toilets for leaks.<br>
Stop using the toilet as an ashtray or waste basket.<br>
Put plastic bottles in your toilet tank - Put an inch of sand or pebbles inside each of two plastic bottles, fill them with water, and put them in your toilet tank, safely away from operating mechanisms. The bottles may displace and save 10 or more gallons of water a day.<br>
Take shorter showers<br>
Install water-saving shower heads or flow restricters.<br>
Take baths - use only a partially-filled tub.<br>
Turn off water after you wet your toothbrush.<br>
Rinse your razor in the sink by filling the sink with a few inches of warm water.<br>
Check faucets and pipes for leaks.<br>
<u>Save Water Outside:</u><br>
Water your lawn only when it needs it.<br>
Deep soak your lawn - water long enough for the moisture to soak down to the roots.<br>
Water during the cool parts of the day - early morning is generally better than dusk since it helps prevent the growth of fungus.<br>
Don't water the gutter - position sprinklers so water doesn't land on paved areas.<br>
Plant drought-resistant trees and plants that need less watering.<br>
Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants.<br>
Use a broom, not a hose, to clean driveways and sidewalks.<br>
Don't run the hose while you wash your car.<br>
Tell your children not to play with the hose and sprinklers.<br>
Check for leaks in pipes, hoses, faucets, and couplings.<br>

<h1><u>Don't Use Plastic!</u></h1>
<p>
	<font size="5" face="arial" color="black">
	Plastic pollution is damaging our environment rapidly. Waste plastic material is hard to dispose of and contributes to major pollution on earth. This has become a cause of global concern. The increasing use of plastic bags, utensils and furniture, the amount of plastic waste has also gone up and so has the plastic pollution. It is time we must take this problem seriously and work towards eradicating it.<br>

	
	Plastic pollution is caused due to the accumulation of the waste plastic material in the environment. Plastic is a non bio-degradable substance. It doesn’t get disposed off in the soil or water and its effect is worse when burnt. It is thus a challenge to dispose it off. It remains in the environment for hundreds of years and causes air, water and land pollution. It is hazardous for the humans, animals as well as the plants. Several animals, birds and marine creatures die due to plastic pollution each year.<br>

	
	Plastic plates, bags, spoons, glasses and other material are readily available in the market. These are economical and easy to use. People prefer using these use-and-throw utensils during gatherings and parties as it shuns the hassle of clearing and cleaning the utensils later. All they need to do is to gather these and throw them away. However, little do they realize that this waste is not disposed off so easily. It continues to remain in the environment and harm us adversely.<br>

	
	 just plastic utensils and carry bags, furniture and various other things made out of plastic are also used extensively world over. It is high time we must realize the harmful effects of plastic pollution and contribute our bit towards bringing it down.<br>

<h1><u>Importance Of Nature!</u></h1><br>
<h2><i>6 reasons why nature is important to us</i></h2><br>
<p>
	<font size="5" face="arial" color="black">

		<u><i>Provides nourishment:</i></u><br>

The most important contribution of nature to human life is, of course, food. It would be impossible to continue to survive on the planet if we did not get nutrition from the planet itself. Imagine if there was no nature around us. That would mean no crops would grow, no animals would roam, and no trees would be there to bear fruits and flowers. The seas, rivers, and ponds would not be there either to provide us with water. There would be literally nothing to eat or drink. Since prehistoric times, man has secured from nature; initially by hunting animals and gathering fruits, then graduating to growing crops, and finally transitioning to our modern kitchens. Today, we can cook delicious dishes and drink purified water, but none of that would be possible had not nature provided us with the raw ingredients.<br>

<u><i>Provides power:</i></u><br>

As humans living in the twenty first century, it is impossible to imagine life without electricity and coal and gas and other forms of fuel. And we get these resources from nature itself. The wind, water, and the sun give us our electricity to power everything from our household appliances and motor vehicles to industrial machinery. The coal and oil reserves are created out of deposits of fossilized plants and animals, proving that nature keeps on giving even after it is long dead. The minerals and metals that we need to build everything from cell phones to wind turbines are all mined from the earth, where they occur naturally.<br>

<u><i>Air to breathe in:</i></u><br>

The very air we breathe is part of nature itself. It is this unique mix of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other gases that makes the air breathable, and the planet a livable place for us. Without this composition, no living being would be able to survive on the planet. The importance of balance of this composition becomes evident when we disrupt this balance; for instance, places with high air pollution become unlivable, with the people and animals becoming susceptible to diseases that lead to a life span cut brutally short.<br>
<u><i>Balanced ecosystem:</i></u><br>

Nature maintains a wonderfully balanced ecosystem. Each animal and plant has a purpose to serve, and anything that becomes redundant is wiped off, gradually or at once. Every being in the system is self-sufficient, drawing nourishment from the resources available around themselves. Most importantly, it is a symbiotic relationship among all the members of the system, which means that even the smallest of disruptions can have pretty serious consequences on the entire ecosystem.<br>

<u><i>Sheer force:</i></u><br>

Even today, when we are technologically sufficient and extremely advanced, we are absolutely at the mercy of nature. This is proven every time a natural calamity strikes- be it a hurricane, a tsunami, or an earthquake. Even today, we know of no way to stop them; in case of earthquakes, we cannot even predict them. All we can do is run for cover when the disaster strikes, and then emerge to survey the damage once it is over. It is the sheer power of nature over us that keeps us on our toes.<br>

<u><i>Inspiration:</i></u><br>

Finally, nature is a potent muse. From poets to artists to the mist prosaic soul, you would be hard put to find a person who is not enthralled by the sheer beauty of nature. Nations earn billions in revenue from tourism thanks to their natural beauty, and great works of art have been created from the inspiration nature provides us.<br>

Today, Mother Nature is in serious danger. We have been too engrossed in our technological advancements and our ability to harness nature’s gifts to truly take care of nature herself. As a result we are on our way to perform the highly self-destructive act of killing the goose the lays the golden eggs. And the signs are visible: natural calamities are more frequent than ever, and we have almost exhausted all our reserves of natural resources. We have killed off a bunch of animals for our selfish reasons, seriously disrupting the ecosystem. Rising global warming and climate change has become a reality, warning us to pull our act together while there is still time.<br>
